# 📡 Payment Service – Spring Boot 

Simplified **payment lifecycle simulation** backend (no real money involved).  
Built with Spring Boot 3 + Java 21. Focuses on domain logic, strict state transitions, ownership checks, role-based access, and proper JWT revocation.

**Important**: This is an educational / portfolio demo project.

---

## 🔎 Features

- Payment states: ` CREATED → AUTHORIZED → CAPTURED → REFUNDED `
- User ownership enforcement (users act only on their own payments)
- Admin override (ROLE_ADMIN can act on any payment + refund)
- Server-side JWT revocation (JTI + sessions table)
- Logout actually invalidates tokens
- @PreAuthorize method security
- Simulated ISO 20022 XML ingestion (placeholder)
- Clear separation 401 (unauthenticated) vs 403 (forbidden/ownership)
---

## 🛠️ How the Payment Flow Works

1. User registers & logs in → gets JWT (with JTI)
2. Create payment → status CREATED (linked to user)
3. Authorize payment → status AUTHORIZED (owner or admin)
4. Capture payment → status CAPTURED (owner or admin)
5. Refund payment → status REFUNDED (admin only)

**Key protections**
- State machine prevents invalid transitions
- Ownership checked in service layer
- Admin can bypass ownership
- Server-side token revocation (not just short expiry)

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or use H2 for quick testing)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ashraf2k04/payment-service.git
   cd payment-service
   ```

2. Copy and configure environment
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env → set JWT_SECRET, DB credentials, etc.
   ```

3. Run with H2 (quick, in-memory)
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=h2
   ```

4. Run with PostgreSQL (default profile)
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   
Application starts on: ```http://localhost:8080```

## 🧪 cURL Full Lifecycle Example

```
# 1. Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice","password":"P@ssw0rd!","role":"ROLE_USER"}'

# 2. Login & save token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice","password":"P@ssw0rd!"}' | jq -r .token)

# 3. Create payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":1000,"currency":"USD","reference":"ORDER123"}'

# 4. Authorize (replace {id})
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/{id}/authorize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 🧾 Notes

- ✔ Payments follow a strict state machine: CREATED → AUTHORIZED → CAPTURED → REFUNDED
- ✔ ROLE_USER can operate only on own payments (create, authorize, capture).
- ✔ ROLE_ADMIN can override ownership and refund any payment.
